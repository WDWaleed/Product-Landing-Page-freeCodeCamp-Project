            The

            is one of the Grade swords. Like all of its predecessor Kitetsu
            swords, this one is said to be a
            <strong>"Cursed Sword/Blade".</strong>
            It is one of Kozuki Sukiyaki's creations.

            The
            <strong>Wado Ichimonji</strong>
            is a sword of great personal importance to Roronoa Zoro. It was
            forged by Shimotsuki Kozaburo and was once a prized heirloom of his
            family. It is also one of the 21 Great Grade swords.[1] After the
            death of its previous owner, Kuina, Zoro asked for it from her
            father, who then gave the sword to him.

            <strong>Enma</strong>
            is one of the 21 Great Grade swords, currently in the possession of
            Roronoa Zoro as one of his three blades.[2] The sword was crafted by
            the swordsmith, Shimotsuki Kozaburo in the Wano Country. Until 20
            years ago, Enma was wielded by Kozuki Oden alongside his other
            sword, Ame no Habakiri. In Oden's hands, both blades became the only
            weapons known to ever (until the present day) injure Kaidou
